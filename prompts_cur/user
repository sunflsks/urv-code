Your job is to evaluate whether a given discourse element (target text)
demonstrates evidence of a particular subskill, and assign it one of four
categories:
-
"emerging" (1): Basic/initial attempt at the subskill.
-
"expanding" (2): Intermediate, shows understanding but not mastery.
-
"exemplifying" (3): Demonstrates strong and mature use of the subskill.
-
"irrelevant": The discourse element does not relate to the given subskill
at all.
Use the student's full essay for context, but focus your judgment on the
**target text**
.
Each subskill has three clearly defined levels of performance. Refer to
these rigorously.
Your output must be a single label corresponding to one of the PERFORMANCE
LEVELS:
Be cautious:
- Don't hallucinate skills not evident in the target text.
- Use the full essay only to resolve ambiguity. You are given the following:
--- FULL ESSAY ---
{essay}
--- TARGET TEXT ---
{target_text}
--- SUBSKILL ---
{subskill}
--- PERFORMANCE LEVELS ---
- Emerging (1): {emerging}
- Expanding (2): {expanding}
- Exemplifying (3): {exemplying}
- Irrelevant: Use this only if the target text does not relate to the
subskill at all.
Please return a label from the PERFORMANCE LEVELS for the TARGET TEXT and
no other extra comments.
